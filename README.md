# Involution: Inverting the Inherence of Convolution for Visual Recognition

Unofficial PyTorch reimplemention of the paper [Involution: Inverting the Inherence of Convolution for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06255.pdf) by Duo Li, Jie Hu, Changhu Wang et al. published at CVPR 2021.

This repository contains a 2D Involution, a fusion of [the official efficient implementation](https://github.com/d-li14/involution) and [ChristophReich1996's PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/ChristophReich1996/Involution).
